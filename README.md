## Techs

I used Next.js to develop this dashboard because:

- Easy to setup and customize
- Easy to deploy with vercel because of its built-in support and optimizations

For the backend, I use Express.js and PostgreSQL for database.
I use express.js for the backend because it is small compared to other frameworks.
I also deploy the backend to Vercel. Vercel also has support for PostgreSQL database management.

## Future improvements

I want to add authentication system such as login page, registration, reset password and user profile page.
Then implement notification feature and some menu in navigation sidebar.
